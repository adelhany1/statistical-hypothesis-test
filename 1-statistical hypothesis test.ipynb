    "are based a statement called the null hypothesis that assumes nothing interesting is going on between whatever **variables** you are testing. \n",
    "\n",
    "The exact form of the null hypothesis varies from one type test to another: if you are testing whether groups differ, the null hypothesis states that the groups are the same. For instance, if you wanted to test whether the average age of voters in your home state differs from the national average, the null hypothesis would be that there is no difference between the average ages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of a hypothesis test is to determine whether the null hypothesis is likely to be true given sample data. If there is little evidence against the null hypothesis given the data, you accept the null hypothesis. If the null hypothesis is unlikely given the data, you might reject the null in favor of the alternative hypothesis: that something interesting is going on. The exact form of the alternative hypothesis will depend on the specific test you are carrying out. Continuing with the example above, the alternative hypothesis would be that the average age of voters in your state does in fact differ from the national average.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have the null and alternative hypothesis in hand, you choose a significance level (often denoted by the Greek letter α.). The significance level is a probability threshold that determines when you reject the null hypothesis. After carrying out a test, if the probability of getting a result as extreme as the one you observe due to chance is lower than the significance level, you reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative. This probability of seeing a result as extreme or more extreme than the one observed is known as the p-value.\n",

In a two-sample test, the null hypothesis is that the means of both groups are the same. Unlike the one sample-test where we test against a known population parameter, the two sample test only involves sample means.

In some cases, you might be interested in testing differences between samples of the same group at different points in time.

A test provides evidence for or against the null hypothesis and then you decide whether to accept or reject it based on that evidence, but the evidence may lack the strength to arrive at the correct conclusion. Incorrect conclusions made from hypothesis tests fall in one of two categories: type I error and type II error.\n",

    "Type I error describes a situation where you reject the null hypothesis when it is actually true. This type of error is also known as a \"false positive\" or \"false hit\". The type 1 error rate is equal to the significance level α, so setting a higher confidence level (and therefore lower alpha) reduces the chances of getting a false positive.\n",
